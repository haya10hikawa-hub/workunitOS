/**
 * P5.5 — Alpha exit criteria / next capability gate contract.
 *
 * Static, read-only guards (matching the repo's alpha-safety-gate / readiness-gate /
 * dry-run / operator-runbook / evidence-ledger test convention) so a future edit cannot
 * silently weaken the Alpha exit checkpoint or the per-capability gate — or let a gate
 * become an authorization to implement a risky capability.
 *
 * This test does NOT touch the network, the GitHub API, child_process, or the filesystem
 * (read-only). It only reads two docs under docs/ and asserts their content.
