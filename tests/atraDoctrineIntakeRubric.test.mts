/**
 * P6.1 — Atra doctrine / information intake policy / decision rubric contract.
 *
 * Static, read-only guards (matching the repo's alpha-safety-gate / design-gate test
 * convention) so a future edit cannot silently weaken the constitution: the product
 * invariant, the intake classifications, the human-review requirements, the external-action
 * boundary, or the capability permission matrix.
 *
 * This test does NOT touch the network, the GitHub API, child_process, or the filesystem
 * (read-only). It only reads three docs under docs/ and asserts their content. It does NOT
 * scan its own source; every required phrase is asserted against the docs.
