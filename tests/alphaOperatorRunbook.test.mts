/**
 * P5.3 — Alpha operator runbook / manual review protocol contract.
 *
 * Static, read-only guards (matching the repo's alpha-safety-gate / readiness-gate /
 * dry-run test convention) so a future edit cannot silently drop the human-decision
 * requirement, a safety boundary, or the explicit non-authorizations.
 *
 * This test does NOT touch the network, the GitHub API, child_process, or the filesystem
 * (read-only). It only reads three docs under docs/ and asserts their content.
