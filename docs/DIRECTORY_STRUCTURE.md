# WorkUnit OS — Directory Structure and Dependency Ownership

## 1. Current structure summary

Current active structure is still hybrid:

- `docs/CONTEXT_INDEX.md`
  - first-read AI context map for canonical files, legacy surfaces, and minimal reading bundles
- `app/components/`
  - canonical dashboard UI
  - adopted v0 dashboard shell under `workunit-os/adopted/`
  - transitional pre-v0 dashboard panes retained but not rendered from `app/page.tsx`
  - legacy WorkUnit Inbox UI compatibility exports
- `app/api/`
  - route handlers for inbox, feedback, integration status, preview, approval, tools
- `app/lib/actionField/`
  - Action Field helpers, now kept as compatibility exports
- `app/lib/application/`
  - canonical home for application-layer orchestration helpers going forward
  - `application/auth/` now owns auth adapter resolution and session resolution
  - `application/dashboard/` now owns client-safe adopted dashboard fetch helpers and view-model mapping
  - `application/workunitInbox/` now owns inbox-facing transforms, read models, and persistence mapping
- `app/lib/domain/`
  - pure domain types and lifecycle/state-machine logic
- `app/lib/domain/auth/`
  - canonical auth/session/role types
- `app/lib/domain/tenant/`
  - canonical tenant types
- `app/lib/persistence/`
  - repository interfaces, resolver, D1 and in-memory implementations
- `app/lib/infrastructure/persistence/control/`
  - control DB repositories for users, tenants, memberships, auth identities
- `app/lib/security/`
  - session gate, RBAC, tenant access helpers, approval, safe error, audit vocabulary
- `app/lib/workunitInbox/`
  - compatibility exports for legacy inbox paths
- `app/components/legacy/workunitInbox/`
  - physical home of the older standalone inbox/detail/action-field UI

## 2. Target structure

Target dependency shape:

```txt
UI
→ API Routes
→ Application Services
→ Domain
→ Repository Interfaces / External Client Interfaces
→ Infrastructure Implementations
→ D1 / External APIs
```

Target directories:

```txt
app/lib/domain/
app/lib/application/
app/lib/infrastructure/
app/lib/config/
```

Suggested long-term specialization:

```txt
app/lib/domain/workunit/
app/lib/domain/approval/
app/lib/domain/integration/
app/lib/domain/audit/
app/lib/domain/usage/
app/lib/domain/tenant/

app/lib/application/workunit/
app/lib/application/actionField/
app/lib/application/integration/
app/lib/application/audit/
app/lib/application/usage/

app/lib/infrastructure/persistence/
app/lib/infrastructure/external/
```

## 3. Allowed dependency direction

Allowed:

- `app/components` → client-safe application helpers and UI-safe types
- `app/api` → security, application, domain, repository resolver
- `app/lib/application` → domain + repository/external interfaces
- `app/lib/domain` → pure types / pure logic only
- `app/lib/persistence/d1` → persistence row helpers and D1-like interfaces only
- `app/lib/infrastructure/external` → normalized source models and external fetch clients

## 4. Forbidden dependencies

Forbidden:

- domain importing React
- domain importing Next route modules
- domain importing D1 implementations
- UI importing D1 repositories directly
- UI importing raw external clients
- repository implementations importing UI
- external clients importing dashboard components
- API routes containing raw SQL directly
- client code creating `tenantId`, `actorUserId`, approval hashes, approval status, or tokens

## 5. Canonical ownership table

| Concern | Canonical module / area | Notes |
|--------|--------------------------|-------|
| Main UI shell | `app/components/workunit-os/WorkUnitOSDashboard.tsx` | Active page entry; wraps the adopted v0 shell |
| Adopted visual shell | `app/components/workunit-os/adopted/AdoptedWorkUnitDashboard.tsx` | Official v0-generated frontend design |
| Canonical Action Field UI | `app/components/workunit-os/adopted/AdoptedWorkUnitDashboard.tsx` | Right pane entry inside the adopted shell |
| Adopted dashboard fetch client | `app/lib/application/dashboard/dashboardDataClient.ts` | Reads `/api/workunit/inbox`, `/api/integrations/status`, `/api/audit/recent` |
| Adopted dashboard view-model | `app/lib/application/dashboard/adoptedDashboardViewModel.ts` | Maps real API data into preserved v0 shell density; empty/loading/error states do not fabricate live WorkUnits |
| Canonical Preview / Approval client | `app/lib/application/actionField/dashboardPreviewClient.ts` | Client-safe application helper |
| Pre-v0 dashboard presentation model | `app/lib/application/dashboard/workUnitDashboardModel.ts` | Transitional model retained for older pane components and tests |
| Legacy Preview / Approval client | `app/lib/workunitInbox/actionFieldClient.ts` | Kept for standalone legacy component |
| Legacy standalone Action Field UI | `app/components/legacy/workunitInbox/WorkUnitActionField.tsx` | Physical home; old path re-exports remain |
| Canonical inbox application logic | `app/lib/application/workunitInbox/*` | Active signal->inbox mapping and persistence mapping |
| Legacy inbox compatibility paths | `app/lib/workunitInbox/*` and `app/components/workunitInbox/*` | Re-export surface only |
| Inbox read boundary | `app/lib/application/workunitInbox/*` | Normalized source → InboxWorkUnit |
| Route persistence access | `app/lib/persistence/repositoryResolver.ts` and `routeRepositories.ts` | Canonical persistence entry |
| Execution approval adapter | `app/lib/persistence/approvalStoreAdapter.ts` | Wraps tenant-scoped approval repository for execution-time verification |
| Tenant DB repository implementations | `app/lib/persistence/d1/` | Infrastructure implementation |
| Session / RBAC / approval security | `app/lib/security/` | Server trust boundary |
| Auth adapter boundary | `app/lib/application/auth/` | Verified identity + session resolution |
| Control DB auth/workspace persistence | `app/lib/infrastructure/persistence/control/` | Control DB infrastructure |
| Provider read clients | `app/lib/infrastructure/external/{github,slack,calendar}` | Canonical home; legacy source paths re-export |

## 6. Transitional modules

Transitional modules still in repository:

- `app/lib/actionField/dashboardPreviewClient.ts`
  - legacy compatibility export
- `app/lib/actionField/errorState.ts`
  - legacy compatibility export
- `app/components/workunitInbox/WorkUnitActionField.tsx`
  - compatibility export to the legacy physical home
- `app/lib/workunitInbox/actionFieldClient.ts`
  - legacy standalone Action Field client
- `app/lib/workunitInbox/sources/**`
  - compatibility exports pointing to infrastructure/external
- `app/components/workunit-os/{WorkUnitExplorerPane,DecompositionConsole,DecisionTracePanel,ActionFieldEntryPanel}.tsx`
  - retained pre-adoption shell components; no longer rendered from the root page

These remain to avoid breaking the current MVP while canonical ownership moves to `app/lib/application/actionField/`.

Phase 1 reduction adds `scripts/report-legacy-surface.mjs` and `tests/architectureLegacySurface.test.mts` to track this surface before deletion.

## 7. High-risk dependency violations and debt

Current architecture debt that remains intentionally deferred:

1. `app/api/workunit/inbox/route.ts` still orchestrates source reads, transform, and persistence directly.
2. `routeRepositories.ts` still resolves tenant DB access without a control-DB-backed workspace auth path.
3. Session enforcement still terminates in `app/lib/security/session.ts`, while verified identity resolution lives in `app/lib/application/auth/`; JWT is now wired, but cookie and OIDC adapters are still deferred.
4. Legacy standalone Action Field modules remain in repository for compatibility.

## 8. Migration plan

1. Keep current MVP behavior stable.
2. Read `docs/CONTEXT_INDEX.md` before architecture-sensitive work.
3. Use `app/lib/application/` for new orchestration helpers.
4. Move new provider clients into `app/lib/infrastructure/external/` rather than expanding route handlers.
5. Migrate imports away from compatibility paths before deleting files.
6. After the Action Field Entry pane fully absorbs the old standalone flow, remove legacy Action Field modules.
7. After Production Auth lands, route tenant DB resolution through control DB membership ownership.
